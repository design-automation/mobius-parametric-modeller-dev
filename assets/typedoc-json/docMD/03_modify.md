# MODIFY    

## Move  
* **Description:** Moves entities. The directio and distance if movement is specified as a vector.
~
If only one vector is given, then all entities are moved by the same vector.
If a list of vectors is given, the each entity will be moved by a different vector.
In this case, the number of vectors should be equal to the number of entities.
~
If a position is shared between entites that are being moved by different vectors,
then the position will be moved by the average of the vectors.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* An entity or list of entities to move.  
  * *vectors:* undefined  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Move(pline1, [1,2,3])  
    Moves pline1 by [1,2,3].  
  * modify.Move([pos1, pos2, pos3], [[0,0,1], [0,0,1], [0,1,0]] )

## Shift  
* **Description:** Shifts the order of the edges in a closed wire.
~
In a closed wire, any edge (or vertex) could be the first edge of the ring.
In some cases, it is useful to have an edge in a particular position in a ring.
This function allows the edges to be shifted either forwards or backwards around the ring.
The order of the edges in the ring will remain unchanged.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Wire, face, polyline, polygon.  
  * *offset:* undefined  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Shift(face1, 1)  
    Shifts the edges in the face wire, so that the every edge moves up by one position
in the ring. The last edge will become the first edge .  
  * modify.Shift(polyline1, -1)  
    Shifts the edges in the closed polyline wire, so that every edge moves back by one position
in the ring. The first edge will become the last edge.

  * *method:* undefined  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**

## Weld  
* **Description:** Unweld vertices so that they do not share positions.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Entities, a list of vertices, or entities from which vertices can be extracted.  
  * *method:* Enum; the method to use for welding.  
* **Returns:** void  
  
## Fuse  
* **Description:** Fuse positions that lie within a certain tolerance of one another.
New positions will be created.
If the positions that are fuse have vertices attached, then the vertices will become welded.
~
In some cases, if edges are shorter than the tolerance, this can result in edges being deleted.
The deletion of edges may also result in polylines or polygpns being deleted.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Entities, a list of positions, or entities from which positions can be extracted.  
  * *tolerance:* The distance tolerance for fusing positions.
 @returns void
  
  
## Remesh  
* **Description:** Remesh a face or polygon.
~
When a face or polygon is deformed, the triangles that make up that face will sometimes become incorrect.
Remeshing will regenerate the triangulated mesh for the face.
Remeshing is not performed automatically as it would degrade performance.
Instead, it is left up to the user to remesh only when it is actually required.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Single or list of faces, polygons, collections.  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Remesh(polygon1)  
    Remeshs the face of the polygon.
  
  
## Delete  
* **Description:** Deletes geometric entities: positions, points, polylines, polygons, and collections.
~
When deleting positions, any topology that requires those positions will also be deleted.
(For example, any vertices linked to the deleted position will also be deleted,
which may in turn result in some edges being deleted, and so forth.)
~
When deleting objects (point, polyline, and polygons), topology is also deleted.
~
When deleting collections, the objects and other collections in the collection are also deleted.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Position, point, polyline, polygon, collection.  
  * *method:* Enum, delete or keep unused positions.  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Delete(polygon1)  
    Deletes polygon1 from the model.
