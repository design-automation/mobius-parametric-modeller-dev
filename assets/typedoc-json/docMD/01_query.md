# QUERY    

## Get  
* **Description:** Returns a list of entities based on a query expression.
The result will always be a list of entities, even if there is only one entity.
In a case where you expect only one entity, remember to get the first item in the list.
~
The query expression should use the following format: #@name == value,
where 'name' is the attribute name, and 'value' is the attribute value that you are searching for.
~
If the attribute value is a string, then in must be in quotes, as follows: #@name == 'str_value'.
The '==' is the comparison operator. The other comparison operators are: !=, >, >=, <, =<.
~
Entities can be search using multiple query expressions, as follows:  #@name1 == value1 &&  #@name2 == value2.
Query expressions can be combined with either && (and) and || (or), where
&& takes precedence over ||.
~
The order of the entities is specified by the 'sort' method. If 'geometrc_order' is slected, then entities are
returned in the order in which they are found within the geometric model. For exampl, when getting positions of a polygon,
then the order of the positions will follow the order of the vertices in the polygon.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *select:* Enum, specifies what type of entities will be returned.  
  * *entities:* List of entities to be searched. If 'null' (without quotes), all entities in the model will be searched.  
  * *query_expr:* Attribute condition. If 'null' (without quotes), no condition is set; all found entities are returned.  
  * *sort:* Enum, sort the entities that are returned in specific order.  
* **Returns:** Entities, a list of entities that match the type specified in 'select' and the conditions specified in 'query_expr'.  
* **Examples:**  
  * positions = query.Get(positions, polyline1, #@xyz[2]>10, 'geometric_order')  
    Returns a list of positions that are part of polyline1 where the z-coordinate is more than 10.  
  * positions = query.Get(positions, null, #@xyz[2]>10, 'ID_descending')  
    Returns a list of positions in the model where the z-coordinate is more than 10.  
  * positions = query.Get(positions, polyline1, null, 'geometric_order')  
    Returns a list of all of the positions that are part of polyline1.  
  * polylines = query.Get(polylines, position1, null, 'ID_descending')  
    Returns a list of all of the polylines that use position1.  
  * collections = query.Get(collections, null, #@type=="floors", 'ID_descending')  
    Returns a list of all the collections that have an attribute called "type" with a value "floors".
  
  
## Invert  
* **Description:** Returns a list of entities excluding the specified entities.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *select:* Enum, specifies what type of entities will be returned.  
  * *entities:* List of entities to be excluded.  
* **Returns:** Entities, a list of entities that match the type specified in 'select'.  
* **Examples:**  
  * objects = query.Get(objects, polyline1, null)  
    Returns a list of all the objects in the model except polyline1.
  
  
## Count  
* **Description:** Returns the number of entities based on a query expression.
The query expression should use the following format: #@name == value,
where 'name' is the attribute name, and 'value' is the attribute value.
If the attribute value is a string, then in must be in qoutes, as follows: #@name == 'str_value'.
The '==' is the comparison operator. The other comparison operators are: !=, >, >=, <, =<.
Entities can be search using multiple query expressions, as follows:  #@name1 == value1 &&  #@name2 == value2.
Query expressions can be combine with either && (and) and || (or), where
&& takes precedence over ||.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *select:* Enum, specifies what type of entities are to be counted.  
  * *entities:* List of entities to be searched. If 'null' (without quotes), list of all entities in the model.  
  * *query_expr:* Attribute condition. If 'null' (without quotes), no condition is set; list of all search entities is returned.  
* **Returns:** Number of entities.  
* **Examples:**  
  * num_ents = query.Count(positions, polyline1, #@xyz[2]>10)  
    Returns the number of positions defined by polyline1 where the z-coordinate is more than 10.
  
  
## Neighbours  
* **Description:** Returns a list of welded neighbours of any entity  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *select:* Enum, select the types of neighbours to return  
  * *entities:* List of entities.  
* **Returns:** Entities, a list of welded neighbours  
* **Examples:**  
  * mod.Neighbours([polyline1,polyline2,polyline3])  
    Returns list of entities that are welded to polyline1 and polyline2.
  
  
## Sort  
* **Description:** Sorts entities based on a sort expression.
The sort expression should use the following format: #@name, where 'name' is the attribute name.
Entities can be sorted using multiple sort expresssions as follows: #@name1 && #@name2.
If the attribute is a list, and index can also be specified as follows: #@name1[index].  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* List of two or more entities to be sorted, all of the same entity type.  
  * *sort_expr:* Attribute condition. If 'null' (without quotes), entities will be sorted based on their ID.  
  * *method:* Enum, sort descending or ascending.  
* **Returns:** Entities, a list of sorted entities.  
* **Examples:**  
  * sorted_list = query.Sort( [pos1, pos2, pos3], #@xyz[2], descending)  
    Returns a list of three positions, sorted according to the descending z value.
  
  
## Type  
* **Description:** Checks the type of an entity.
~
For is_used_posi, returns true if the entity is a posi, and it is used by at least one vertex.
For is_unused_posi, it returns the opposite of is_used_posi.
For is_object, returns true if the entity is a point, a polyline, or a polygon.
For is_topology, returns true if the entity is a vertex, an edge, a wire, or a face.
For is_point_topology, is_polyline_topology, and is_polygon_topology, returns true
if the entity is a topological entity, and it is part of an object of the specified type.
~
For is_open, returns true if the entity is a wire or polyline and is open. For is_closed, it returns the opposite of is_open.
For is_hole, returns ture if the entity is a wire, and it defines a hole in a face.
For has_holes, returns true if the entity is a face or polygon, and it has holes.
For has_no_holes, it returns the opposite of has_holes.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* An entity, or a list of entities.  
  * *query_ent_type:* Enum, select the conditions to test agains.  
* **Returns:** Boolean or list of boolean in input sequence.  
* **Examples:**  
  * query.Type([polyline1, polyline2, polygon1], is_polyline )  
    Returns a list [true, true, false] if polyline1 and polyline2 are polylines but polygon1 is not a polyline.
