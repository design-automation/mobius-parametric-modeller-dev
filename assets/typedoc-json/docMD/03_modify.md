# MODIFY    

## Move  
* **Description:** Moves entities. The directio and distance if movement is specified as a vector.
~
If only one vector is given, then all entities are moved by the same vector.
If a list of vectors is given, the each entity will be moved by a different vector.
In this case, the number of vectors should be equal to the number of entities.
~
If a position is shared between entites that are being moved by different vectors,
then the position will be moved by the average of the vectors.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* An entity or list of entities.  
  * *vectors:* undefined  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Move(pline1, [1,2,3])  
    Moves pline1 by [1,2,3].  
  * modify.Move([pos1, pos2, pos3], [[0,0,1], [0,0,1], [0,1,0]] )  
    Moves pos1 by [0,0,1], pos2 by [0,0,1], and pos3 by [0,1,0].  
  * modify.Move([pgon1, pgon2], [1,2,3] )  
    Moves both pgon1 and pgon2 by [1,2,3].

    Offsets the wires inside polygon1 by 10 units. Holes will also be offset.
  
  
## Collection  
* **Description:** Modifies a collection.
~
If the method is 'set_parent', then the parent can be updated by specifying a parent collection.
If the method is 'add_entities', then entities are added to the collection.
If the method is 'remove_entities', then entities are removed from the collection.
If adding or removing entities, then the entities must be points, polylines, or polygons.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *coll:* The collection to be updated.  
  * *entities:* Points, polylines, and polygons, or a single collection.  
  * *method:* Enum, the method to use when modifying the collection.  
* **Returns:** void  
  
## Reverse  
* **Description:** Reverses direction of entities.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Wire, face, polyline, polygon.  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Reverse(face1)  
    Flips face1 and reverses its normal.  
  * modify.Reverse(polyline1)  
    Reverses the order of vertices to reverse the direction of the polyline.
  
  
## Shift  
* **Description:** Shifts the order of the edges in a closed wire.
~
In a closed wire, any edge (or vertex) could be the first edge of the ring.
In some cases, it is useful to have an edge in a particular position in a ring.
This function allows the edges to be shifted either forwards or backwards around the ring.
The order of the edges in the ring will remain unchanged.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Wire, face, polyline, polygon.  
  * *offset:* undefined  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Shift(face1, 1)  
    Shifts the edges in the face wire, so that the every edge moves up by one position
in the ring. The last edge will become the first edge .  
  * modify.Shift(polyline1, -1)  
    Shifts the edges in the closed polyline wire, so that every edge moves back by one position
in the ring. The first edge will become the last edge.
  
  
## Close  
* **Description:** Closes polyline(s) if open.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* undefined  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Close([polyline1,polyline2,...])  
    If open, polylines are changed to closed; if already closed, nothing happens.
  
  
## Remesh  
* **Description:** Remesh a face or polygon.
~
When a face or polygon is deformed, the triangles that make up that face will sometimes become incorrect.
Remeshing will regenerate the triangulated mesh for the face.
Remeshing is not performed automatically as it would degrade performance.
Instead, it is left up to the user to remesh only when it is actually required.
~  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Single or list of faces, polygons, collections.  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Remesh(polygon1)  
    Remeshs the face of the polygon.
  
  
## Delete  
* **Description:** Deletes geometric entities: positions, points, polylines, polygons, and collections.
When deleting positions, any topology that requires those positions will also be deleted.
(For example, any vertices linked to the deleted position will also be deleted,
which may in turn result in some edges being deleted, and so forth.)
For positions, the selection to delete or keep unused positions is ignored.
When deleting objects (point, polyline, and polygons), topology is also deleted.
When deleting collections, none of the objects in the collection are deleted.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Position, point, polyline, polygon, collection.  
  * *del_unused_posis:* Enum, delete or keep unused positions.  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Delete(polygon1)  
    Deletes polygon1 from the model.
  
  
## Keep  
* **Description:** Keeps the specified geometric entities: positions, points, polylines, polygons, and collections.
Everything else in the model is deleted.
When a collection is kept, all objects inside the collection are also kept.
When an object is kept, all positions used by the object are also kept.  
* **Parameters:**  
  * *entities:* Position, point, polyline, polygon, collection.  
* **Returns:** void  
* **Examples:**  
  * modify.Delete(polygon1)  
    Deletes polygon1 from the model.
